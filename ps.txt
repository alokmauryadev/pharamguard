RIFT 2026 HACKATHON 
Pharmacogenomics / Explainable AI Track 
PRECISION MEDICINE ALGORITHM 
PharmaGuard: Pharmacogenomic Risk Prediction 
System 
Multi-city Hackathon  •  HealthTech Track 
PROBLEM OVERVIEW 
Adverse drug reactions kill over 100,000 Americans annually. Many of these deaths are 
preventable through pharmacogenomic testing — analyzing how genetic variants affect drug 
metabolism. 
Your task is to build an AI-powered web application that analyzes patient genetic data (VCF 
files) and drug names to predict personalized pharmacogenomic risks and provide clinically 
actionable recommendations with LLM-generated explanations. 
CORE CHALLENGE 
Build a system that: 
• 1. Parses authentic VCF files (Variant Call Format — the industry standard for genomic 
data) 
• 2. Identifies pharmacogenomic variants across 6 critical genes: CYP2D6, CYP2C19, 
CYP2C9, SLCO1B1, TPMT, DPYD 
• 3. Predicts drug-specific risks: Safe, Adjust Dosage, Toxic, Ineffective, Unknown 
• 4. Generates clinical explanations using LLMs with specific variant citations and 
biological mechanisms 
• 5. Provides dosing recommendations aligned with CPIC guidelines 
APPLICATION SPECIFICATIONS 
Input Requirements 
1. VCF File Upload 
• File format: .vcf (Variant Call Format v4.2) 
• File size: Up to 5 MB 
• Structure: Standard VCF with INFO tags (GENE, STAR, RS) 
• Sample files provided in public test cases 
2. Drug Name Input 
• Format: Text input field 
• Support: Single drug or multiple drugs (comma-separated) 
• Supported drugs: CODEINE, WARFARIN, CLOPIDOGREL, SIMVASTATIN, 
AZATHIOPRINE, FLUOROURACIL 
• Optional: Support for additional drugs 
Output Requirements 
Your application MUST generate structured JSON output matching this EXACT schema: 
{ "patient_id": "PATIENT_XXX", 
"drug": "DRUG_NAME", 
"timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp", 
"risk_assessment": { "risk_label": "Safe|Adjust Dosage|Toxic|...", 
"confidence_score": 0.0, "severity": "none|low|moderate|high|critical" }, 
"pharmacogenomic_profile": { "primary_gene": "GENE_SYMBOL", 
"diplotype": "*X/*Y", "phenotype": "PM|IM|NM|RM|URM|Unknown", 
"detected_variants": [ { "rsid": "rsXXXX", ... } ] }, 
"clinical_recommendation": { ... }, 
"llm_generated_explanation": { "summary": "...", ... }, 
"quality_metrics": { "vcf_parsing_success": true, ... } 
} 
Web Interface Requirements 
1. File Upload Interface 
• Drag-and-drop or file picker 
• VCF file validation before processing 
• File size limit indicator 
2. Drug Input Field 
• Text input or dropdown selection 
• Support for multiple drugs (comma-separated or multi-select) 
• Input validation 
3. Results Display 
• Clear visual presentation of risk assessment 
• Color-coded risk labels (Green = Safe, Yellow = Adjust, Red = Toxic/Ineffective) 
• Expandable sections for detailed information 
• Downloadable JSON output + Copy-to-clipboard functionality 
4. Error Handling 
• Clear error messages for invalid VCF files 
• Graceful handling of missing annotations 
• User-friendly error explanations
