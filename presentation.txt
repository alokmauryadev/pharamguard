# Presentation: PharmaGuard - AI-Powered Pharmacogenomics

## Slide 1: Title Screen
**Title:** PharmaGuard
**Subtitle:** Precision Medicine, Simplified.
**Tagline:** Preventing Adverse Drug Reactions with GenAI & Genomics.
**Presenter:** Alok M, Full Stack Engineer

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Headline:** The Silent Danger of "One Size Fits All" Medicine
- **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)** are a leading cause of hospitalization globally.
- Standard prescribing does not account for **genetic variations** (e.g., Enzyme deficiencies like CYP2C19).
- **Complexity**: Genetic data (VCF files) is unreadable to most clinicians.
- **Gap**: Lack of tools that bridge raw genetic data with actionable clinical insights instantly and securely.

## Slide 3: The Solution - PharmaGuard
**Headline:** Personalized Drug Safety at Your Fingertips
- **What it is**: A web application that analyzes patient DNA (VCF files) to predict drug response.
- **How it works**:
    1. Upload Genetic Data (VCF).
    2. Select a Medication (e.g., Clopidogrel).
    3. Get Instant Risk Assessment (Metabolizer Status) + AI Explanation.
- **Goal**: Empower clinicians and patients to make safer medication choices.

## Slide 4: Key Features
**Headline:** Advanced Tech, Simple Experience
1.  **Universal VCF Parsing**: Extracts relevant variants (RSIDs) from raw genetic files securely in the browser/server memory.
2.  **Clinical-Grade Risk Engine**: Rules-based logic grounded in **CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium)** guidelines.
3.  **GenAI "Doctor" Integration**: Uses **Google Gemini** to translate complex phenotypes (e.g., "*2/*2 Diplotype") into plain English advice.
4.  **Privacy-First Architecture**: Zero data retention. Analysis happens in a transient session; no patient DNA is stored.

## Slide 5: Technology Stack
**Headline:** Built for Speed & Security
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS (Modern, Responsive UI).
- **Backend/API**: Next.js Server Functions (Edge-ready).
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@google/genai` SDK).
- **Data Processing**: Custom VCF Parser & JSON-based Knowledge Base.
- **Reporting**: `jspdf` & `html2canvas` for generating downloadable PDF reports.

## Slide 6: Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
**Headline:** Why PharmaGuard?
1.  **The "Why" Factor**: Unlike standard tools that just say "High Risk," PharmaGuard uses an LLM to explain *biological mechanisms* (e.g., "Your liver enzyme is inactive, leading to toxicity").
2.  **Zero-Trust Privacy**: Competitors often store DNA data. We don't. Your genetic code leaves RAM only when you close the tab.
3.  **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines deterministic clinical rules (100% accuracy for guidelines) with probabilistic AI (for explanation and context), ensuring safety + clarity.

---

## Slide 7: Future Scope
**Headline:** Roadmap to Revolutionize Prescribing
1.  **EHR Integration**: Direct API connections to hospital Electronic Health Records (Epic, Cerner).
2.  **Expanded Drug Database**: Scaling from top cardiac/psychiatric drugs to a full formulary (200+ drugs).
3.  **Population Health Analytics**: (Optional opt-in) Aggregating anonymized data to find population-specific risk trends.
4.  **Mobile App**: A "Wallet" for your genetic data to show any doctor, pharmacy, or ER.
5.  **Multi-Omics Support**: Incorporating other health markers beyond just DNA.
